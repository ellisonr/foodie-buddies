# Foodie Buddies

## Audience

The audience for this project is for anyone that loves to eat great food. It's kind of a Wikipedia-like site in that anyone is allowed to add and make changes to restaurant and menu entries. If a restaurant already exists, visitors will be allowed to make comments on the existing menu entries or to create a new menu entry for another dish.
There is a search feature which will allow people to search for restaurants based on desired cuisine.

## Technologies Used

-  Python
-  Django
-  Sass
-  PostgreSQL

## Packages

-  django
-  psycopg2-binary
-  django-extensions
-  ipython

## Project Approach

-  Prioritize planning stage.
-  Use planning homework as a way to narrow down a project idea.
-  Take it step by step using class lessons in order to build an app with django.
-  Commit early and often.
-  Take a step back from more technical items by working on styling.

## Things I Learned

-  I learned to incorporate SASS more into this project.
-  I learned to incorporate a search feature in django. (I lost this feature after massive deployment issues. I will try to recoup this feature very soon!)
-  I am learning to deploy a django app.
